	 <h1>Liliuhms</h1>
	<h3><a href="https://liliuhms.com">liliuhms.com</a></h3>
	<img src="img/homepage.png" alt="The screen shot of the website">
	<h4>Navigation</h4>
	<p>The headings are clearly labeled with additional subheadings for the types of artworks she is exhibiting. The subheadings are available once the user hovers over the heading so as not to overwhelm them with information. Under each subheading is a collection of images and videos of her artworks and exhibitions with a description of the main idea or type of event at the top of the page. The descriptions are simple and get to the point of the page in a clear manner.</p>
		
	<h4>Usability</h4>
	<p>The images all load fairly quickly for the high volume of content, although there are instances where they don't load at all and the user has to refresh the page. Sometimes there are embedded videos which can all be played on the site itself. Clicking on a link opens up a new tab which is preferable for users who want to continue navigating the main site without having to go back from the new one.</p>
	
	<h4>Typography and hierarchy</h4>
	<p>The typography is sans serif and often not properly capitalized or punctuated, which gives it a childish feeling appropriate for the designer's work. There is a good hierarchy with the opening statement on who the designer is in the biggest font size to catch the user's attention, then descending in size with each lesser important heading. However, the body text size is rather small and makes it hard to read without looking closely. Each type of heading is given a different color to differentiate it from the body text.</p>
	
	<h4>Overall style/look and feel</h4>
	<p>The website has a pleasant and comforting atmosphere remniscent of a children's storybook. The typography reflects this atmosphere along with the primary color scheme and informal grammar. There are cute illustrations both animated and static scattered around the website that create the feeling of a storybook or a casual sketchbook. All of these factors add up to a cohesive and recognizable branding that represents the artist's work without being too overwhelming on the eyes.</p>
